This Java project contains three classes and some sample text files: 

* Histogram
* UniqueNames
* WordCount

Histogram prints out a histogram with the input file requiring a series of numbers (scores) each on their own line.

UniqueNames prompts the user for names. The output shows you the names you put in with any duplicates dropped.

WordCount processes a text file and shows the line count, character count, and word count.
