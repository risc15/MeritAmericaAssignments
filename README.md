# MeritAmericaAssignments
Repository containing my coursework for Merit America and other online classes.

Because Github did not allow me to organize my repos into folders, I moved everything into one repository. Has the side-effect of making my Github activity look way less busy, however...

Contains work from September 2020 to January 2021.
